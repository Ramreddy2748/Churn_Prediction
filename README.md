# Churn_Prediction-using-_different_models

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a churn prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.



**The ML Pipeline that I have followed is :**
  Importing the necessary libraries and the dataset
  Performing Data Preprocessing (Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Manipulation)
  Modelling using **Decision Tree,Random Forest, XGBoost**(Extreme Gradient Boosting)
  Performing Prediction
  Visualization of data
## Visualization of different accuracy_score in diff models
